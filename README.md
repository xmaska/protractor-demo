# Demo test report generated by the test framework

<a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/xmaska/protractor-demo/blob/master/reports/test-report.html">Test report with Firefox and Chrome</a>


## Issues found
1. In chrome, the page keeps reloading after login and it breaks the entire functionality. (this is why chrome test fails in automation report)
2. When the sign-up form is filled but the backend validation fails, the error reason is not returned to the user. (for example phone number is not matching with the required format for the country specified)

## List of features that are not covered by the business requirements

- Describe how to obtain rewards, what games to play in order to get them (List of dependencies)
- What to show when moving the mouse over the thumbnail, list all other actions that can be performed!
- Should be the Freebies Vault section hidden if the user does not have any rewards/tokens?
